1. SUPERVISED LEARNING 
   - Data: labelled (input -> known output) 
   - Goal: learn a mapping from input to label 
   - Algorithms: neural networks, decision trees, SVM 
   - Use when: you have historical examples with correct answers 
 
2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING 
   - Data: unlabelled (input only) 
   - Goal: discover structure (clusters, anomalies) 
   - Algorithms: k-means, PCA, autoencoders 
   - Use when: you want to segment or compress without labels 
 
3. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING 
   - Data: no dataset; an agent interacts with an environment 
   - Goal: learn a policy that maximises cumulative reward 
   - Algorithms: Q-learning, policy gradients 
   - Use when: sequential decisions with delayed feedback

Unsupervised: We HAVE labels (SalaryBand), so we don't need

Reinforcement: There is no sequential decision process or
